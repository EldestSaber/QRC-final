# Final Team Project QRC Machine Learning Programme
## Introduction
#### This repository contains the final project of the QRC Machine Learning Programme. This is a combined project of two teams in the course, the data cleaning team and the model creation team. 
## Scenario
#### Suppose you have just been hired by Kiwibank as a ML practitioner. You are to take over ownership of a fraudulent transaction ML detection system. Your supervisor warns you there is not much documentation, and the system’s performance must be improved and made ‘fairer.’ When you ask for more details, they say to figure it out yourself and provide them with potential solutions.
## Data description
### Below is a description of the features and labels of the dataset. The only recognisable features and labels were the time, monetary amount, and whether or not that specific transaction was fraudulent. 
#### Features:
- Time - Recorded transaction
- V1-V28 - Unspecified features
- Amount - Monetary amount for specified transaction
#### Label:
- Class - Whether or not the specified transaction is fraudulent (0 = non-fraudulent, 1 = fraudulent)
